# site-treelinks
Scrape user-provided URL for site-tree (down and dirty)

***Note: this is an early dev-release, as such it is missing just about every feature imaginable.
***User must enter full http:// or https:// prefix before site URL as I am not doing any validation atm

***Feel free to fork and use this code however you like :)
